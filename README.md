This code uses a simple dictionary to store the translations of individual words.This approach will work for simple sentences with a limited number of words, but it's not suitable for large-scale or complex translation tasks. In that case, it's better to use a machine translation API like the Google Cloud Translation API.
The steps to set up a Google Cloud Platform account and create a project with the Cloud Translation API enabled:
* Go to the Google Cloud Console at https://console.cloud.google.com/
* Click the project drop-down and select or create the project want to use for the API.
* Go to the API Library and search for the "Google Cloud Translation API".
* Click the API to open its overview page and then click the "Enable" button.
* Once the API is enabled, go to the Credentials page and click the "Create credentials" button.
* Choose "Service account" as the type of credentials you need and click the "Create" button.
* Fill out the form to create a new service account. You can set the role to "Project" > "Editor" to allow the API to have full access to your project.
* Click the "Create Key" button to create a JSON key file that you can use to authenticate your API requests.
* Save the JSON file to your local machine and set the path to it in your code.
